## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Erick Zanardo, I am Brazilian and I have been working with software development since 2008. I have worked with many different platforms and stacks along my carrier, like Java, NodeJs, Ruby, Vanilla JS, React and many others.

Since 2016 I have been focusing on mobile development, where I started with React Native and then moved to Flutter, where I stayed and where I am focusing my carrier as well as my OSS efforts.

I help maintain a couple of Flutter packages and projects, but the ones that I am most know from are [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/), a Flutter based game engine and [Nes UI](https://github.com/erickzanardo/nes_ui), a Flutter design system inspired by retro game consoles!

I create games under [Cherry Bit Studios](https://cherrybit.studio/), some are free, and some are paid, but no game will ever rely in predatory monetisation methods!

Check all of them on my [web site](https://cherrybit.studio/games/)!
